<span style="font-size:larger;">__copyComb__:</span> &nbsp; Program designed to accept a directory and compare every file in it with every other file in it (subdirectories included). Suite also includes a verifier designed to exhibit redundant files to user, and a deletion function to delete all identical files but one.  
### Addendum:  
Improved "2.0" version completed; see Python project, "cCheck.py"  
~~Want to write a manual byte-by-byte comparison algorithm like cmpRehenCve (see C folder), to see how much runtime improvement that might or might not offer over the current equality comparison method.~~

<span style="font-size:larger;">__reaveScript__:</span> &nbsp; AKA "netReaver", my attempt to self-teach how to design an internet scraper. Initial run yielded ~20,000 files, with a coverage rating of .9767081. That is, the scraper missed a total of 2.5% of the images hosted on the root site. Satisfactory first run
