<span style="font-size:larger;">__copyComb__:</span> &nbsp; Program designed to accept a directory and compare every file in it with every other (subdirectories included). Intended purpose is to weed out duplicates by "combing" through directories, esp picture backup directories. Currently nearing multiprocessed (as in, multiple individual iterations of Python which do not share a Global Interpreter Lock and so are more powerful than standard multithreading) version as of 05/04/2023, when spare time became much shorter in supply.

<span style="font-size:larger;">__reaveScript__:</span> &nbsp; AKA "netReaver", my attempt to self-teach how to design an internet scraper. Initial run yielded ~20,000 files, with a coverage rating of .9767081. That is, the scraper missed a total of 2.5% of the images hosted on the root site. Satisfactory first run

<span style="font-size:larger;">__wallpaperChanger__:</span> &nbsp; Wallpaper randomizer for GNOME environments which do not natively support the 'Slideshow' function for OS backgrounds
