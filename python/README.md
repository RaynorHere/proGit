# MANIFEST  
Specific program descriptions are contained in the code files themselves, but here is an overview:  

<span style="font-size:larger;">__copyComb__:</span> &nbsp; Program designed to accept a directory and compare every file in it with every other file in it (subdirectories included). Suite also includes a verifier designed to exhibit redundant files to user, and a deletion function to delete all identical files but one.  
Active intent to develop this one further  
  
<span style="font-size:larger;">__reaveScript__:</span> &nbsp; AKA "netReaver", my attempt to self-teach how to design an internet scraper. Initial run yielded ~20,000 files, with a coverage rating of .9767081. That is, the scraper missed a total of 2.5% of the images hosted on the root site. Solid for a maiden voyage  
  
<span style="font-size:larger;">__wallpaperChanger__:</span> &nbsp; Wallpaper randomizer for GNOME environments which do not natively support the 'Slideshow' function for OS backgrounds
