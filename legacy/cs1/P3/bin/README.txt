##Overview
This program's purpose is to provide a library object, which serves to, through a provided menu, contain (add), remove, read, and print lists of, book objects provided to it by the user.


##Compiling and Using
Ensure the LibraryOfBooks, the Book.java file, and the Library.java file are all located in the same directory. Additionally, ensure any .txt files of the books you will add are either located in the same directory, or you know the directory address that they are in; you will be asked to enter them when you add them to the library. 

Navigate to the directory containing the .java files, and enter:

javac LibraryOfBooks.java

And then,

java LibraryOfBooks


##Sources Used
