/*
Let's make a tribute to an old classic. This is actually the game that got me started on my
Computer Science journey, when I was about five years old. I just hope it fits.
Fair warning: I am completely insufferable; I hope my code isn't too painful to read.
Also, I wanted to try doing this in Eclipse, just to get started getting used to it. KWrite is 
really limited.
