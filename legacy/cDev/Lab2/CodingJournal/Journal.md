Ah, this is a nice callback. The second part, anyway; ASCII art was the first assignment we had in CS121, back in my very first Fall semester. I put in way more effort than was necessary then, but I mirrored the "M" on the DOOM logo that time. This time, I took an opportunity to fix it.

As my obsessive commenting will show, as well, I wanted to try my hand at being a dumb overachieve-y nerd with the warmup; I wanted to see if I could use the carat operator to do power arithmetic in C. Short answer: no. Long answer: not ONLY no, but there are some wonky caveats to the power calculation the computer does. Caveats I am fuzzily aware of (it doesn't just add values together, it's actually doing math with binary coded decimals, meaning the flipping of bits can result in bizarre outcomes), but not well enough to do anything about. Beyond which, that's a little TOO "overachieve-y nerd" for this assignment.

Anyway, always super glad to learn more about more languages, and doubly so now that I have my coding suite set up on my host machine, with all my plugins and the like in the proper place. I like being able to come to a single program, whether I'm writing in Java, C, or (with where 354 is right now) Python; it's pretty excellent.
