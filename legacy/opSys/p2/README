TESTING:

DISCUSSION:
 
 This project in general the coding was easy but the IDE (in my case Visual Studio)
 was pretty cool in the beginning but things like the actual window not matching the
 design I made was frustrating. And often the program was pretty slow to start the
 code. In general as I have experience in C I felt like it was pretty smooth sailing
 for the code itself. There were some weird things in C# like how there is Int32, 
 Int64, decimals, vars, and other specialized variables or that class and method 
 names didn't use the same kind of casing. But it didn't feel like it was too far 
 out there.
