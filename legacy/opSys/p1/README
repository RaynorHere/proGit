OVERVIEW:

 This program takes in a file and will count the number of unique
 words (a dictionary) similar to a Java HashMap.


INCLUDED FILES:
 * wf.py - driver
 * docs - contains all text files
 * README - this file


COMPILING AND RUNNING:
To run the file:
```
$ python wf.py [text file]
```
If the text file is not defined the program will run the 
Gettysburg-Address.txt

Console output will give the results after the program finishes.


PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

The main idaea was to pass in a file and break it into smaller bits
and count how many those bits were used. The main concepts were 
reading in a file, using delimiters, replacing symbols, creating a list, 
and sorting lists.

TESTING:

 This project was mostly tested using our terminal and comparing the output
 to a given example output file.


DISCUSSION:
 
 This project in general was pretty easy for me as I have some background with 
 Python. As a transfer student to Boise State my first programming language I 
 learn was Python. I did hit a stumbling block with passing in the arguments
 via the command line as my mind was trying do it like we would for Java but
 I eneded up remember how to do it. And I used https://www.w3resource.com/
 python-exercises/dictionary/python-data-type-dictionary-exercise-1.php as 
 a reference for sorting the dictionary.
